# Public Usage

## What Storybook is for

Storybook is the public source of truth for:

- component APIs
- visual behavior and states
- composition examples
- roadmap and implementation standards

## How to evaluate the system quickly

1. Start with `Documentation/1. Presentation`.
2. Review `Documentation/2. Architecture`.
3. Check `Documentation/3. Patterns`.
4. Explore `Atoms/*`, `Molecules/*`, and `Organisms/*` stories.
5. Read `Documentation/4. Features` and `Documentation/5. Roadmap`.

## Consumer guidance

- Prefer tokenized and variant-based APIs.
- Reuse existing layout primitives before custom wrappers.
- Compose from atoms/molecules first, then extend with organisms.
- Use theme provider and semantic color tokens for branding.

## Reporting issues

Use `Documentation/6. Contributions` and open issues with:

- reproducible story path
- expected behavior
- current behavior
- acceptance criteria
