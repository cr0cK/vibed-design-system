# Contributions

## Contribution model

This project is not currently open to direct external code contributions.

Preferred flow:

1. Open an issue with the problem.
2. Provide concrete context:
   - what component/story is affected
   - expected vs actual behavior
   - screenshots or recordings when relevant
   - reproduction steps
3. Include clear acceptance criteria.
4. The issue is then handled in dedicated LLM implementation sessions with validation and traceable commits.

## Issue quality checklist

- Scope is narrow and actionable.
- Reproduction is deterministic.
- Impact and priority are explicit.
- Constraints are stated (design, API, accessibility, backward compatibility).

## Internal implementation checklist

When an issue is picked up for implementation, the session validates:

1. `pnpm typecheck`
2. `pnpm --filter @vibed/design-system build`
3. `pnpm --filter @vibed/storybook build`
4. `pnpm test:e2e`
