# Features

## Core capabilities

- Themeable components with token-driven styling.
- Shared design tokens for color, spacing, radius, shadows, and typography.
- Composable atom/molecule/organism architecture.
- Context and Zustand support for local complex state.
- Storybook-first documentation and showcase coverage.
- Playwright E2E validation for critical interaction flows.

## Theming and tokens

- Components consume semantic tokens instead of hard-coded colors.
- Themes can be swapped through provider context.
- Variant styling remains consistent via `buildVariants`.

## Accessibility baseline

- Focus management utilities (`FocusTrap`, `ClickOutside`, `Portal`) reused by overlays.
- Escape and outside-click behavior standardized in overlay patterns.
- Keyboard navigation implemented for interactive controls.
- Automated E2E checks include keyboard interaction and targeted axe assertions.

## Composition model

- Atoms provide low-level reusable primitives.
- Molecules compose atoms into richer controls.
- Organisms orchestrate full UI flows with minimal ceremony.

## Engineering quality

- Explicit props and stable APIs.
- Build and typecheck gates.
- Storybook static build as public artifact.
