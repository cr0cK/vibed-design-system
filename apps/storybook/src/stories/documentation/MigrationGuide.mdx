# Migration Guide

Consumer migration notes are tracked in `MIGRATIONS.md`.

## Current notable renames

- `Toast`: use `heading` prop (instead of `title`).
- `Sidebar`: use `heading` prop (instead of `title`).
- `Menu` / `DropdownMenu`: use `onItemSelect` (instead of `onSelect`).

## Upgrade workflow

1. Upgrade dependency version.
2. Run `pnpm typecheck` in the consumer app.
3. Fix renamed props from the migration notes.
4. Verify visual output against Storybook.
