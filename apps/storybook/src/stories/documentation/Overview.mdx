# Presentation

Vibed Design System is built as a guided, LLM-driven implementation project.

The core idea is simple:

- define strict engineering rules first
- implement iteratively with short feedback loops
- validate with typecheck, build, stories, and E2E tests
- keep architecture and patterns explicit in docs

## Vibed-coded philosophy

This design system does not come from ad-hoc UI work.  
It is generated and maintained through focused LLM sessions, constrained by clear conventions:

- explicit and typed APIs
- composable atomic architecture
- shared accessibility utilities
- theme and token discipline
- pragmatic consistency over ceremony

## Documentation map
